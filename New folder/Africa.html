    <h1>AFRICA</h1>

<hr>
    <P>The history of Africa begins with the emergence of hominids, archaic humans and - around 300–250,000 years
        ago—anatomically modern humans (Homo sapiens), in East Africa, and continues unbroken into the present as a
        patchwork of diverse and politically developing nation states.[1] The earliest known recorded history arose in
        Ancient Egypt, and later in Nubia, the Sahel, the Maghreb, and the Horn of Africa.</P>

    <p>Following the desertification of the Sahara, North African history became entwined with the Middle East and
        Southern Europe while the Bantu expansion swept from modern day Cameroon (Central Africa) across much of the
        sub-Saharan continent in waves between around 1000 BC and 1 AD, creating a linguistic commonality across much of
        the central and Southern continent</p>

    <p>During the Middle Ages, Islam spread west from Arabia to Egypt, crossing the Maghreb and the Sahel. Some notable
        pre-colonial states and societies in Africa include the Ajuran Empire, Bachwezi Empire, D'mt, Adal Sultanate,
        Alodia, Warsangali Sultanate, Buganda Kingdom, Kingdom of Nri, Nok culture, Mali Empire, Bono State, Songhai
        Empire, Benin Empire, Oyo Empire, Kingdom of Lunda (Punu-yaka), Ashanti Empire, Ghana Empire, Mossi Kingdoms,
        Mutapa Empire, Kingdom of Mapungubwe, Kingdom of Sine, Kingdom of Sennar, Kingdom of Saloum, Kingdom of Baol,
        Kingdom of Cayor, Kingdom of Zimbabwe, Kingdom of Kongo, Empire of Kaabu, Kingdom of Ile Ife, Ancient Carthage,
        Numidia, Mauretania, and the Aksumite Empire. At its peak, prior to European colonialism, it is estimated that
        Africa had up to 10,000 different states and autonomous groups with distinct languages and customs>
