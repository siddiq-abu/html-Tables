    </h1>

    <hr>
    <p>Before March 1957 Ghana was called the Gold Coast. The<span style="color: blue;"> Portuguese</span> who came to
        Ghana in the 15th century found so
        much gold between the rivers Ankobra and the Volta that they named the place Mina - meaning Mine. The Gold Coast
        was later adopted to by the English colonisers.</p>

    <p>In 1598 the Dutch joined them, and built forts at Komenda and Kormantsil. In 1637 they captured the castle from
        the Portuguese and that of the town of Axim in 1642 (Fort St Anthony). Other European traders joined in by the
        mid 18th century. These were the English, Danes and Swedes. The coastline were dotted by forts built by the
        Dutch, British and the Dane merchants. By the latter part of 19th century the Dutch and the British were the
        only traders left. And when the Dutch withdrew in 1874, Britain made the Gold Coast a crown colony.</p>

    <p>The Gold Coast was the first British colony in<a href="./Africa.html"><b><i>Africa</i></b></a> to become
        independent. After independence, its name changed
        to Ghana, and the first president was Kwame Nkrumah. Ghana is in West Africa, in the Gulf of Guinea. Its
        neighbouring countries are Cote D'Ivoire, Togo, and Burkina Faso, and the capital is Accra. The name Ghana comes
        from an ancient kingdom several 100 kilometres northwest of the modern republic. Archaeological remains found in
        the coastal zone indicate that the area has been inhabited since the early Bronze Age (ca. 4000 B.C.), but these
        societies, based on fishing in the extensive lagoons and rivers, left few traces. Archaeological work also
        suggests that central Ghana north of the forest zone was inhabited as early as 3,000 to 4,000 years ago. Oral
        history and other sources suggest that the ancestors of some of Ghana's residents entered this area at least as
        early as the tenth century A.D. and that migration from the north and east continued thereafter. These
        migrations resulted in part from the formation and disintegration of a series of large states in the western
        Sudan.</p>

    <p>The trans-Saharan trade that contributed to the expansion of Kingdoms in the western Sudan also led to the
        development of contacts with regions in northern modern Ghana and in the forest to the south. By 13th Century,
        for example, the town of Jenné in the empire of Mali, had established commercial connections with the ethnic
        groups in the savannah woodland areas of the northern two-thirds of the Volta Basin in modern Ghana. Jenné was
        also the headquarters of the Dyula, Muslim traders who dealt with the ancestors of the Akan-speaking peoples who
        occupy most of the southern half of the country. Although the rulers themselves were not usually Muslims, they
        either brought with them or welcomed Muslims as scribes and medicine men, and Muslims also played a significant
        role in the trade that linked southern with northern Ghana. As a result of their presence, Islam substantially
        influenced the north. Muslim influence, spread by the activities of merchants and clerics, has been recorded
        even among the Asante to the south. Although most Ghanaians retained their traditional beliefs, the Muslims
        brought with them certain skills, including writing, and introduced certain beliefs and practices that became
        part of the culture of the peoples among whom they settled</p>
